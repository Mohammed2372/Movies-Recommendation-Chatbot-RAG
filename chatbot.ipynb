In all of them, the good guys ultimately prevail over the bad guys. However, if you're looking for a movie where the bad guy wins, I would suggest checking out \"No Country for Old Men\" (directed by Joel Coen and Ethan Coen) or \"The Departed\" (directed by Martin Scorsese). Both of these films have complex plots and unexpected twists that lead to surprising endings. In \"No Country for Old Men,\" the main antagonist, played by Javier Bardem, seems almost invincible at times, making his eventual victory all the more shocking. And in \"The Departed,\" the line between good and evil becomes increasingly blurred as the two main characters, played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon, struggle to outsmart each other. While both movies have their fair share of heroes, the villains are just as compelling and memorable, making them standouts in the genre.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":27},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Test the bot with searching in the document\nprint(\"Searching database for evidence...\")\ndocs = vector_db.similarity_search(\"I want action movie after 2015\", k=4)\n\nprint(\"\\n--- WHAT THE DATABASE FOUND ---\")\nfor i, doc in enumerate(docs):\n    print(f\"\\n[Document {i+1}]: {doc.metadata['title']}\")\n    print(f\"Snippet: {doc.page_content.replace(chr(10), ' ')[:200]}...\") # Clean up newlines","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-12-02T22:45:45.481003Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-12-02T22:45:45.481528Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-12-02T22:45:45.552399Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-12-02T22:45:45.481503Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-12-02T22:45:45.551619Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Searching database for evidence...\n\n--- WHAT THE DATABASE FOUND ---\n\n[Document 1]: eXistenZ\nSnippet:      Movie Title: eXistenZ     Director: David Cronenberg     Cast: Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jude Law, Ian Holm, Willem Dafoe, Don McKellar, Oscar Hsu, Callum Keith Rennie, Christopher Eccleston, Sarah P...\n\n[Document 2]: eXistenZ\nSnippet:      Movie Title: eXistenZ     Director: David Cronenberg     Cast: Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jude Law, Ian Holm, Willem Dafoe, Don McKellar, Oscar Hsu, Callum Keith Rennie, Christopher Eccleston, Sarah P...\n\n[Document 3]: Last Action Hero\nSnippet:      Movie Title: Last Action Hero     Director: John McTiernan     Cast: Arnold Schwarzenegger, F.
